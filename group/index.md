# Working Group Membership

The Singer Working Group is comprised of several companies each invested in the success of the Singer Spec.

## Member Companies

In working group documents, members are referred to as "Member Companies", "Group Members", or simply "Members".

Members do not pay dues and do not receive any payment for membership. To be considered for membership, a company must have some history of using Singer and contributing within the community, and they should have reference to their own use of Singer on their company's external website.

## Group Leadership

We aim to always have 3 companies in position of leadership, called "Leading Members" in our working group documents.

The current Leading Members are:

- [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com) - Maintainers of the [SDK for Taps and Targets](https://sdk.meltano.com/en/latest/) and [MeltanoHub for Singer](https://hub.meltano.com/singer/).
- [Talend](https://www.talend.com) - Maintainers of [Singer.io](https://Singer.io), the [Singer Spec docs](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/SPEC.md), and [StitchData.com](https://stitchdata.com). 
- [Wise](https://wise.com/us/) - Maintainers of [PipelineWise](https://transferwise.github.io/pipelinewise/).

### Responsibilities of Leadership

Leading Members are expected to:

1. Regularly attend and participate in working group sessions,
2. Participate in proposal review discussions, and
3. Register a vote on new proposals within the designated voting period of each proposal.

## New Members

In general, we are open to accepting any company into our group which is similarly committed to the success of the Singer spec and the Singer community.

New membership invites may be proposed by way of nomination internally. Any existing Member Company may nominate a company to be invited, subject to approval by majority vote from the Leading Members.
